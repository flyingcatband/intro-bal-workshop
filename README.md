# Introduction to playing for balfolk by Flying Cat

Here's some tunes we like, and some associated words about how [Flying Cat](https://flyingcat.dance) think about playing for balfolk dancing. 

Originally we put this workshop together for online [IVFDF](https://www.ivfdf.org) in 2021, and this is a slightly updated and more interactive version for [Skint](https://www.skintdance.org.uk/) in 2023.
